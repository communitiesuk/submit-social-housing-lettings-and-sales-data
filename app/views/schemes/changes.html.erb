    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is a scheme?</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">A supported housing scheme (also known as a ‘supported housing service’) provides shared or self-contained housing for a particular client group, for example younger or vulnerable people.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is a location?</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">A location is a postcode area where supported housing is provided under a scheme. A scheme can have multiple locations, and a location can have multiple units at the same postcode.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How schemes have changed</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">We have restructured the way we group supported housing scheme data.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">On old CORE, a scheme’s data was split into management group and scheme. On new CORE, the data is split into scheme and location.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">These are the main changes:</p>
    <%= govuk_list [
      "Schemes now store data about the stock owner and support provider. This was previously stored in management group.",
      "Schemes still store data about the type of support, as they did in old CORE.",
      "Schemes no longer store data about postcodes where support is provided. These are now in locations.",
    ], type: :bullet %>
    <p class="govuk-body">This new structure means data coordinators only needs to fill in support details once.</p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How schemes are migrated from old CORE</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">If your organisation has migrated from old CORE to new CORE, your existing schemes are on the <%= govuk_link_to("schemes page", schemes_path) %>, with the same details.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Your migrated schemes have been restructured to match the new structure described above. Schemes with the same support details have been combined to prevent duplicates.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">All migrated schemes have new names and codes. The new scheme names were created automatically based on their support details. Some of these auto-generated names are quite long, so we recommend data coordinators rename them.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you upload logs in bulk, you can use either the new or old scheme codes in your template.</p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you can’t find a scheme</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">You should be able to recognise a scheme migrated from old CORE by viewing its details or locations. Try searching for it by postcode.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you still can’t find a scheme that was migrated from old CORE, either create a new one if you know the details, or <%= govuk_link_to("contact the helpdesk", GlobalConstants::HELPDESK_URL, rel: "noreferrer noopener", target: "_blank") %> to report the problem. Only data coordinators can create and edit schemes.</p>
